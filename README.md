# C-Questions
Q: What is a namespace?
Namespaces are a separation technique that contain members and keep levels of code separate.
Q: What are value types?
Value types allow you to directly assign a value to an object. You can use multiple different types in order to match the data you wish to assign.
Q: What are reference types?
Reference types do not actually directly assign data to an object, instead, they offer a sort of reference to the actual location of the value.
Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
An automatic property allows you to write clearer, more concise code, and can be used when you want to write a declaration but don’t want to write out the full logic.
Q: What is the purpose of using statement?
The using statement obtains the resource you wanted to use, executes the command, and then disposes. This one statement cleans up your code.
Q: What are dynamic type variables?
Dynamic type variables have their type assessed at run time, and the type can be changed from its initial setting.
Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?
The “is” operator is used to check if an object is compatible with a type.
Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?
Generics can be used as placeholders for fields, methods and parameters. This is useful because you no longer have to rewrite the placeholders all the way out, just the generic.
Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?
Broad, the public specification means that the member variables and functions can be accessed from outside the class and used be other functions and objects.
Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?
Yes, granted you uses Params.
Q: How do you sort an array?
Use Array.Sort(Array).
Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?
A nullable type is a means of assigning null, or nothing as a value. This can be used in counting with numeric values or can also be used in bool statements.
Q: What is an enumeration?
Enumeration is a set of named integer constraints.  It contains its own values and does not have inheritance.
Q: What is inheritance?
The process of making a class and having it inherit attributes from another class. 
Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?
C# does not allow multiple inheritance.
Q: What is the purpose of as operator?
Operators perform arithmetic or binary manipulation of operands.
Q: What is an object?
An object is an instance of a class which is created dynamically and is unique from other objects in the class.
Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?
Struct is a value type while a class is a reference type.
Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?
Break terminates the current loop and moves onto the next, while continue does not force the termination and instead might be used for another iteration of the loop.
Q: What is this and how is it used?
This is a keyword that references the current instance of the class and could be used as a modifier for parameters of a later extension.
Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?
Try and catch are error detecting processes. These are used to ensure the program ran correctly and if not, set up a means to deal with the error.
Q: How is exception handling done?
One would use a try, catch, and finally block with the catch being the appropriate catch type.
Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?
The finally allows you to execute code if you trigger it, and would allow you to delete objects that must be deleted granted an exception is thrown.
Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
Array is a fixed size while ArrayList is dynamic size, Array list can only contain object elements, Array can’t use generics but ArrayList can.
Q: What is an object?
An object is an instance of a class which is created dynamically and is unique from other objects in the class.
Q: Define constructor.
A constructor is basically a class wherein, the constructor adds new objects into the class when prompted with new.
Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
Var can only be used when the variable is local and declared, and you would have to use the foreach command to determine.
Q: What is an abstract class?
A class that can’t be instantiated and instead is used for inheritance for other classes.
Q: What is an interface?
An interface is a means to link and deal with multiple classes, and helps maintain the overall code.
Q: What is a method?
A method is a block of code that has a series of statements and can be called via the method.
Q: What is a property?
Properties are actually an accessor, and they access data simply and flexible enough for use with methods.
Q: What is an access specifier?
An access specifier denotes how open the data is to the rest of the code. i.e. (private or public).
Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
Private- limited to only inside the class or struct it’s currently in.
Public- accessible from anywhere.
Internal- Accessible from same assembly level and contains its declaration.
Protected Internal- more or less the same as Internal and Protected. 
Protected-limited to the class or struct as well as the inherited class.
Q: What is a collection?
Collection classes are special classes for data storage and retrieval. 
Q: What is a Hash Table?
It's a collection type of object, which stores on the basis of KEY, VALUE.
